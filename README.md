## 2. Install the App

### Step 1: Install the App on Your System
1. Download the installer file from [here](https://github.com/Blackfire-IamaPineapple24/Cortana/releases) and run it.

This will automatically install the app on your system.  
2. Pin the app to your taskbar.

2. Select your preferred Date Format

3. Select the Location closest to you in the dropdown. I'm still working on this, so there's only a few available.

4. Enter or paste your API Key, click **OK**, and start chatting with Cortana!

**Tip:** You can use Microsoft PowerToys’ Keyboard Manager to bind Win+C to open Cortana. The app should be located in `C:/Program Files/Cortana`.

**VirusTotal Scan:** SmartScreen flags the installer, so [here's](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d7f996f6ceb0b3c3d8df307fb2378f9933a1eec988a68279cd6afd9bb34c6993?nocache=1) a scan of the file to prove it's safe.

This is **not Cortana**. This program is intended to resemble and behave like Cortana. It runs on Arli AI's Google Gemma 3 model. Microsoft owns the trademarks for the Cortana name and logo; I do not claim ownership of any of these assets. Microsoft was not involved in the creation or production of this program.
I made this for myself, using ChatGPT, mostly. I do not claim to have written all of this code, but I did write some - edited CSS and instructions. I'm going to update the code gradually over the next year or so.

**Update**: As the project has grown I've started to shy away from AI more. It's still been used but as I say eventually the AI code will be cleaned up, functional, understood and well made. Hopefully.
