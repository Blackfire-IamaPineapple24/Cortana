Enter it, click **Submit**, and start chatting with Cortana!

**Tip:** You can use Microsoft PowerToys’ Keyboard Manager to bind Win+C to open Cortana. The app should be located in `C:/Program Files/Cortana`.

**VirusTotal Scan:** SmartScreen flags the installer, so [here's](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/564377b1c9855597e864b10f11b4307d76b4b03e7a84113e08ebcc6cf52aa010?nocache=1) a scan of the file to prove it's safe.

This is **not Cortana**. This program is intended to resemble and behave like Cortana. It runs on Arli AI's Google Gemma 3 model. Microsoft owns the trademarks for the Cortana name and logo; I do not claim ownership of any of these assets. Microsoft was not involved in the creation or production of this program.
I made this for myself, using ChatGPT, mostly. I do not claim to have written all of this code, but I did write some - edited CSS and instructions. I'm going to update the code gradually over the next year or so.
